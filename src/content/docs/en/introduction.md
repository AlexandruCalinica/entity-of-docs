**Welcome to the Entity.of official docs!**

**Entity.of** is a framework for managing the data layer in your javascript/typescript application.

What you can do with Entity.of:
- Typeguard raw data at runtime (e.g. every bit of data is handled by an entity)
- Log unexpected or mismatching data (e.g. when an API changes)
- Standardize the way data is generated (e.g. objects are created by entities)
- Use entities as user defined TS types (single source of types for props, params, etc.)
- Monitor associations between entities and develop a better understanding of your data
- Structure and organize your data in a way that makes sense for your application

> **Entity.of** runs both in browser and node.js environments and has zero dependencies.
