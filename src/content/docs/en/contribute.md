Finding a bug or want to contribute to the project? This guide will help you get started.

### Finding an issue
Here's the list of all the current [issues](https://github.com/AlexandruCalinica/Entity.of/issues). We use GitHub to track bugs and features. Please search the existing issues before filing new ones to avoid duplicates. For new contributors, the **"good first issue"** and **"help wanted"** labels are a great place to get started.

#### Issues available for community contribution
  The following lables mark issues that are available for community contribution:
  1. [good first issue](https://github.com/AlexandruCalinica/Entity.of/labels/good%20first%20issue) - Open to participation from the community and friendly towards new contributors.
  2. [help wanted](https://github.com/AlexandruCalinica/Entity.of/labels/help%20wanted) - Open to participation from the community but not necessarily beginner-friendly

#### Issues not available for community contribution
  The following lables mark issues that are not available for community contribution:
  1. [staff only](https://github.com/AlexandruCalinica/Entity.of/labels/%F0%9F%94%92%20staff%20only) - Not open to participation from the community.

Check the issue comments/labels to see whether someone else has indicated that they are working on it. If someone is already working on it and there has been activity within the last 7 days, you may want to find a different issue to work on.

### Contribution process
1. Comment on it and say you're working on that issue. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue. If you've followed the guidelines above, you don't need to ask permission to start work on an issue.
2. Write your code and submit your pull request. Be sure to read and follow the [pull request guidelines]()!
3. Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.

> **A note on collaboration:** We encourage people to collaborate as much as possible. We especially appreciate contributors reviewing each other's pull requests, as long as you are kind and constructive when you do so.

### Proposing a new issue
If you want to work on something that there is no GitHub issue for, follow these steps:

1. Create a new GitHub issue associated with the relevant repository and propose your change there. Be sure to include implementation details and the rationale for the proposed change. We are very reluctant to accept random pull requests without a related issue created first.
2. The issue will automatically have the <u>ðŸš¦ status: awaiting triage</u> label applied. Wait for a project maintainer to evaluate your issue and decide whether it's something that we will accept a pull request for.
3. Once the project maintainer has approved the issue and removed the <u>ðŸš¦ status: awaiting triage</u> label, you may start work on code as described in the "Contribution process" section above.
